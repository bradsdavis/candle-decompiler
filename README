Introduction
===============================
Candle Decompiler only decompiles a subset of the JVM operations at this point; if you are looking for a decompiler, please check out the many closed options at this point.  Candle Decompiler has a long way to go to catch up with these fine tools, and this is more of a testing ground than anything at this point.

Closed Source Alternative Decompilers

* Fernflower
* Java Decompiler - http://java.decompiler.free.fr/
* JAD


Contributing to Candle Decompiler 
================================
Please consider contributing to the project if you are interested in decompilation.  The flow control is implemented in BlockVisitor currently, and is missing a lot of logic right now.  Intermediate Code assembly occurs within IntermediateVisitor.  To contribute back to the code, please issue a pull-request against the project.


Special thanks to the following:
=================================

Apache BCEL - http://commons.apache.org/bcel/
==================
Leveraging BCEL to parse the Java class and walk the assembly code.

JReversePro Team
==================
Great resource for getting to know decompilers.  Karthik Kumar, thanks for open sourcing!

Java Virtual Machine, by Jon Meyer and Troy Downing
==================
Good book & online resource for understanding the JVM stack & operations.

James Hamilton - http://jameshamilton.eu/
==================
Provides some really helpful online samples of code -> assembly.

Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_syntax, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings
==================
Great source of information related to JVM instructions.
